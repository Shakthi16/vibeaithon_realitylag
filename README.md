# Reality-Lag Security  
&gt; “We don’t block hackers — we make them live inside our illusion while the real system heals and learns.”

## 🔍 What is Reality-Lag Security?
Reality-Lag (RLS) is the world’s first **dual-timeline deception engine** for e-commerce.  
It forks the universe into two parallel timelines:

| Real Timeline | Shadow Timeline |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Legitimate shoppers | Suspicious actors |
| Genuine data & APIs | Hyper-realistic fakes |
| Zero disturbance | Full attack capture |
| Self-healing in background | Inception-mode recursion |

---

## 🧠 Core Innovation
1. **Adaptive Deception** – dynamic fake environments that evolve faster than attackers can fingerprint.  
2. **Self-Healing Core** – automatic rollback & patch while the attacker is still busy.  
3. **Reverse-Engineering-as-a-Service** – every exploit becomes labeled training data.  
4. **Multi-Shadow Inception** – recursive illusions; when suspicion rises, drop them deeper.
